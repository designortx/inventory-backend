now using postgre SQL and the complete documentation is yet to come out

Had some issues with user created with postgreSQL, it kept saying 'permission denied for schema public'. Once the the user created from PostgreSQL was given Superuser role, everything works just fine.

### Steps to Grant Superuser Privileges to a PostgreSQL User:

1.  **Log in to PostgreSQL** as a superuser (like `postgres`):  
    Open your terminal and log in to PostgreSQL using the `psql` command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
    This command allows you to access the PostgreSQL prompt as the `postgres` user (the default superuser in PostgreSQL).
    
2.  **Grant Superuser Role** to the Desired User:  
    Once inside the PostgreSQL prompt (`psql`), you can grant the superuser role to an existing user. Use the following SQL command, replacing `your_user` with the username of the user you want to grant superuser privileges to:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER USER your_user WITH SUPERUSER;
    ```
    For example, if your PostgreSQL username is `myuser`, the command would look like this:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER;
    ```
    
3.  **Exit PostgreSQL**:  
    After running the command, exit the `psql` prompt by typing:
    
    ```sql
    \q
    ```
    This will bring you back to the regular shell.

### 4. **Verify the Userâ€™s Superuser Privileges**:

You can verify that the user now has superuser privileges by logging into PostgreSQL again and running the following command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

# DEPRECATED 

1. Check If MySQL Server Is Running

```sh
sudo systemctl status mysql

```
If it's not running, start it:
```sh
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

2. Verify MySQL Port
Open /etc/mysql/my.cnf and check:
```ini
[mysqld]
port=3306
```
If it's not 3306, update your backend config to match.


If MySQL is running on 3306, update your .env or connection settings in ormconfig.json:
```json
{
  "type": "mysql",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3306,  // Change to correct port
  "username": "root",
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "database": "yourdatabase",
  "synchronize": true,
  "logging": false
}
```

3. Check If MySQL Accepts Connections

Try connecting via MySQL CLI:
```sh
mysql -u root -p
```
If you get an error, ensure MySQL is running.

Also, ensure MySQL accepts TCP connections (not just sockets). In my.cnf:
```ini
[mysqld]
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```
Restart MySQL after changes:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart mysql  # Linux/macOS
```
4. Grant MySQL Permissions

Sometimes, MySQL rejects external connections. Run:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Then restart MySQL.

5. Check Firewall/Antivirus
Your firewall may block MySQL. Try:
    Temporarily disable the firewall and check.
    Allow MySQL in Windows Firewall:
```sh
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MySQL" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3306
```


ðŸ›  Final Fix (If All Else Fails)
```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1"
}
```
If using Docker, check if MySQL is running inside your container.


# Summary:

1. Ensure MySQL is running (sudo systemctl status mysql).

2. Check MySQL port (3306 vs 3360).

3. Enable external connections (bind-address = 0.0.0.0).

4. Grant privileges (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES...).

5. Disable firewall temporarily.
